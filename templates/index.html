        <h1>Welcome to the Drift Lens tool ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
        <b>Drift Lens</b> is an <b>unsupervised drift detection</b> technique for deep learning models on unstructured data.
        It is based on distribution distances of the embedding representations of deep learning models.
        The tool is able to perform <b>real-time</b> drift detection and characterization by indicating i) <i>when</i>, ii) <i>how</i> , and iii) <i>where</i> drift occurs.
        Specifically, it is able to detect in which data windows drift occur, the severity and pattern, and which labels have been mostly affected.
    </p>


    You can experiment with drift detection on:
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Pre-uploaded use cases:</b> Where drift can be controlled with several patterns and intensities on pre-uploaded models and data. (<a href="/documentation">Run Controlled Drift Experiment</a>)</li>
            <li><b>Your own data:</b> Where you can upload your data to verify if drift is present in new data streams. (<a href="/documentation">Run Your Drift Experiment</a>)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
